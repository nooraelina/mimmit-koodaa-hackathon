# Digitraining
### :computer: A project created during Mimmit koodaa -hackathon! `17.9.-19.9.2021` (with lots of :coffee:)
## Purpose of the app?
A way to evaluate digital skills that will benefit both the job seeker and those providing services to them.

## Features
- Frontpage as well as fuctional navbar to move to testing and contact page
- That's it, that's the app!

All jokes aside, our prime creation was a mock-up created in Figma. It shows the same front page as here, but in addition it has the logged in state, where user can see their finished and unfinished tests, download certificates and send their skill evaluation to Helsinki City's services. Also there's the example of thje basic computer skills test to show, how the primary functionality goes.
For the admin side, there's example of how the data is shown and used. It shows tips, where the is room for improvement and where things are going great. The data is also exportable in a csv format.

## Tech

Digitraining uses a number of open source projects to work properly:

- <b>React</b> - A Way to build big, fast Web apps with JavaScript
- <b>Helsinki Design System, HDS</b> - The open-source design system for digital products and experiences with the City of Helsinki Design Language at its heart. The Helsinki Design System is focused on usability and accessibility and aims to improve the quality and consistency of City of Helsinki digital services â€“ making the user experience better for everyone.
